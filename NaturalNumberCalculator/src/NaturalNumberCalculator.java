/**
 * Natural Number Calculator application.
 *
 * This is a very simple "RPN" (Reverse Polish Notation) calculator. There are
 * two operands, both of which always have natural number values. Direct entry
 * of a number is always to the bottom operand in the display. The "Clear"
 * button sets the bottom operand to 0. The "Swap" button exchanges the values
 * of the two operands. The "Enter" button copies the value of the bottom
 * operand to the top operand. Each operator button operates on the two operands
 * in their natural order as displayed in the interface (e.g., "-" subtracts the
 * bottom operand from the top operand), and each replaces the bottom operand
 * with the result of the operator and the top operand with 0; except that
 * division replaces the bottom operand with the quotient and the top operand
 * with the remainder.
